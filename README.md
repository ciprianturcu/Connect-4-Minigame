# Connect-4-Minigame

## Problem Statements
The game is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)
- Implemented computer AI using a [minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). Computer play should be competitive against the human player.
- In addition to the console-based user interface required, I also implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for the program.
## Requirements

- Use object oriented programming and layered architecture
- All modules with the exception of the UI will be covered with specifications and PyUnit test cases
- The program must protect itself against the userâ€™s invalid input
